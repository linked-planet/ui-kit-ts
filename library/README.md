# UI-Kit-TS

This ui-kit is based on atlaskit and some other dependencies to contain a full
ui-kit instead of a long list of single dependencies. It also integrates a stack of data handling
with redux, react-query, axios to work with backed rest data.

Checkout the online demo of the [showcase](https://linked-planet.github.io/ui-kit-ts/) on github.
